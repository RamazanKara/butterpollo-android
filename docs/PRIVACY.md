# Butterpollo privacy

Applies to Butterpollo for Android 0.4.0.

Butterpollo streams your PC's desktop, apps, video and audio directly to your
Android device. Your controls and any clipboard text you choose to send go to
your PC. Butterpollo does not operate a streaming relay, advertising service,
analytics service or automatic crash-report upload service.

## What stays on your device

Butterpollo stores saved and paired hosts, including their names, addresses,
identifiers and host certificates. It also stores the client certificate and
private key used for pairing, a locally generated client identifier, app and
per-PC settings, controller mappings, and cached app lists and artwork.

A short, redacted event log is kept in memory. A redacted record of the latest
crash or abnormal exit is saved locally. Optional latency logging saves a local
CSV file when you enable it. Preparing a problem report creates a temporary
local file. These records can include the app version, Android version, device
model, decoder settings, timing measurements and crash details.

## Network connections

Stream content, input and clipboard transfers are between your device and the
PC you connect to. Pairing exchanges identity information with that PC. Host
discovery also uses your local network.

The current app also makes public network checks. It can contact
`stun.moonlight-stream.org` to find an external network address and
`android.conntest.moonlight-stream.org` to diagnose connection failures. Those
servers receive your public IP address and network protocol traffic. They do
not receive your stream, clipboard or problem reports. Their retention
practices are not established by this repository.

Opening a help or source link contacts the website you choose to visit. The
site and your browser apply their own privacy practices.

## Sharing a problem or crash report

Butterpollo does not automatically send problem or crash reports. A report is
shared only after you choose Share and select a receiving app in Android's
share sheet. Canceling the sheet does not share the report. The report omits
addresses, user-assigned host names, PINs, credentials and free-text diagnostic
details. The receiving app controls what happens to the report afterward.

## Backups and deletion

Android backup and device transfer are enabled. Depending on your Android
settings, eligible app data, including the saved-host database and optional
latency files, may be backed up or transferred by Android. Client certificates,
private keys, the client identifier and preferences are excluded. Crash records
and temporary report files are kept outside Android backup.

Remove a saved PC in Butterpollo to remove its saved-host entry. Revoke pairing
on the PC to remove that device's access there. Clear Butterpollo's app storage
or uninstall it to remove its local data. Separately delete any exported logs,
shared reports or Android backups using the app or service holding them.

Butterpollo has no developer-hosted user account to delete. For questions about
this policy, use the contact details on the Butterpollo store listing.
