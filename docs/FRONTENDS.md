# Launcher integrations

[Documentation](index.md)

Rubylight can stream a game opened from ES-DE, Daijisho, Pegasus or another Android launcher. Exported `.art` entries identify the paired PC and app; the launcher opens the entry with Rubylight.

## ES-DE

1. Pair the PC in Rubylight and open its library once to refresh the cached app list.
2. Long-press the PC and choose **Add games to ES-DE**.
3. Select the ROMs folder used by ES-DE. The exporter creates a `butterpollo` subfolder containing a game entry for each visible app.
4. Select the ES-DE folder to merge the custom system and copy cached covers. Skip this step when exporting only game files for another frontend.
5. Restart ES-DE and open its **Rubylight** system.

On Android 11+, select the actual ROMs/ES-DE directories rather than a restricted storage root. Repeat export after changing the host library. Entries are updated in place; same-name games from different PCs are disambiguated.

The exporter uses these literal paths and identifiers:

| Relative to selected folder | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| ROMs: `butterpollo/*.art` | Game entries; hidden apps are omitted. |
| ES-DE: `custom_systems/es_systems.xml` | Merged Rubylight system definition; other systems are retained. |
| ES-DE: `custom_systems/es_find_rules.xml` | Android component lookup. |
| ES-DE: `downloaded_media/butterpollo/covers/` | Available cached game covers. |

The generated system uses `%ROMPATH%/butterpollo`, extensions `.art .ART`, the `pc` platform and `windows` theme. Its command is:

```text
%EMULATOR_BUTTERPOLLO% %ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TASK% %ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP% %ACTION%=android.intent.action.VIEW %DATA%=%ROMPROVIDER%
```

The Android component is `com.butterpollo.client/com.limelight.ShortcutTrampoline`. The root flavor substitutes `com.butterpollo.client.root` for the package.

## Daijisho

Create a platform for `.art` files and point it at the exported ROMs subfolder. Configure its Android player with the following intent arguments:

```text
-n com.butterpollo.client/com.limelight.ShortcutTrampoline -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d {file.uri}
```

The frontend must provide a readable file/content URI and grant read access to it.

## Pegasus

Use the exported entries with an Android launch command:

```text
launch: am start -n com.butterpollo.client/com.limelight.ShortcutTrampoline -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d {file.uri}
```

`{file.uri}` is supplied by the frontend, not entered as a literal address.

## Entry format and direct intents

A game entry is plain UTF-8 text. This example uses synthetic identifiers:

```text
# Rubylight game entry
[host_uuid] 11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
[host_name] Gaming PC
[app_uuid] 22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222
[app_name] Example game
[app_id] 1234567
```

The host UUID is preferred over its name. The app UUID is preferred over a numeric ID, then an app name; name lookup uses the known app list. Entries without app fields open the PC library.

A launcher can also target the same component with these string extras instead of a file:

| Extra | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `UUID` | Paired host UUID. |
| `Name` | Host name if UUID is absent. |
| `AppUuid` | Preferred app UUID. |
| `AppId` | Numeric application ID. |
| `AppName` | App name to resolve from the known library. |

The parser is [FrontendEntry.java](../app/src/main/java/com/limelight/utils/FrontendEntry.java), export paths/commands are in [FrontendExporter.java](../app/src/main/java/com/limelight/utils/FrontendExporter.java), and intent handling is in [ShortcutTrampoline.java](../app/src/main/java/com/limelight/ShortcutTrampoline.java) and the [manifest](../app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml).

## Fix an integration

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Game file cannot be opened | Invalid entry or unreadable URI. | Re-export; make sure the launcher grants read access. Keep `%ROMPROVIDER%` in the ES-DE command. |
| PC not found | PC is not saved on this Android installation. | Pair it here and export again. |
| Library opens instead of the game | Entry has no usable app fields. | Open the PC library to refresh it, then re-export. |
| Rubylight system absent in ES-DE | Configuration folder was skipped/wrong or ES-DE has not reloaded it. | Select the correct ES-DE folder, check both custom XML files, then restart ES-DE. |
