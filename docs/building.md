# Building Rubylight

[Documentation](index.md)

## Install a published or development build

Get published APKs from [Rubylight releases](https://github.com/RamazanKara/rubylight-android/releases), or build one yourself as described below. Open the APK on Android 5.0 or newer and allow installation from the app opening it; no root is needed. With USB debugging enabled, `adb install -r app-nonRoot-debug.apk` also installs it.

Updates require the same signing key. Debug APKs built on different machines use different keys; changing keys requires uninstalling the old app, which removes settings and pairing identity. The normal package ID remains `com.butterpollo.client`.

## Toolchain and source

Use JDK 17 and the Android SDK/NDK already installed on your machine. The repository pins compile SDK 37, target SDK 36, minimum SDK 21, NDK `29.0.14206865`, Android Gradle Plugin `9.4.0` and Gradle `9.7.1`. Check [app/build.gradle](../app/build.gradle), [build.gradle](../build.gradle) and the [wrapper configuration](../gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties) when updating the toolchain.

Clone the Android repository with its native submodules:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/RamazanKara/rubylight-android.git
cd rubylight-android
```

For an existing checkout:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive --jobs 2
```

[.gitmodules](../.gitmodules) identifies the native core submodule; recursive initialization includes its dependencies. Use a Windows JDK and Windows SDK for PowerShell, or Linux toolchains when building inside WSL. Set `JAVA_HOME` to the installed JDK 17 directory and `ANDROID_HOME` to the installed SDK, or use `sdk.dir` in untracked `local.properties`. SDK licenses and the pinned SDK/NDK must already be available.

## Build and tests

From the repository root in PowerShell:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat --no-daemon --max-workers=2 :app:assembleNonRootDebug :app:lintNonRootDebug :app:testNonRootDebugUnitTest
```

On Linux/macOS:

```sh
bash gradlew --no-daemon --max-workers=2 :app:assembleNonRootDebug :app:lintNonRootDebug :app:testNonRootDebugUnitTest
```

`--no-daemon` avoids retaining a build daemon and `--max-workers=2` limits Gradle workers. Native make and unit-test forks are also capped at two in the app build. Add `--offline` only when the wrapper distribution and dependencies are cached; it does not supply missing artifacts. For a smaller arm64-only APK, add `-PabiFilters=arm64-v8a`; comma-separated ABI values are also accepted.

The JVM suite includes Robolectric tests. Reports go to `app/build/reports/tests/testNonRootDebugUnitTest/index.html` and `app/build/reports/lint-results-nonRootDebug.html`. A failed lint/test task is a failed check even when assembly succeeds.

The existing CI also runs a standalone native parser/negotiation test on Linux:

```sh
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 app/src/test/native/pyrowave_frame_test.cpp -o /tmp/pyrowave-frame-test
/tmp/pyrowave-frame-test
```

These commands match [the Android workflow](../.github/workflows/android.yml). The optional [emulator smoke script](../scripts/emulator-smoke.py) requires an already configured Android SDK, Python and its expected AVD.

### UI smoke captures

After building debug, `python scripts/emulator-smoke.py` uses the `sunset` Android 35 AVD in a headless disposable session. It refuses to start beside another emulator and stops its emulator in a `finally` block. It installs the APK, adds a loopback server-info fixture and walks the pairing guide, one-time PIN and host-details dialogs, PC profile input/save/reopen/reset, settings, bitrate and global reset. It also checks Advanced search and per-PC global inheritance. The fixture holds the PIN prompt open without completing pairing or starting a stream.

The capture matrix is 393 dp and 412 dp at default font size, plus 393 dp at font scale 1.3. Screenshots go to `docs/screenshots/ui-v2/` (native dimensions, palette PNG when Pillow is available); UI dumps and logcat go to `app/build/emulator-smoke/`. The debug-only overlay preview uses labeled synthetic values, supports rotation and long-press switching, and is absent from release builds. Its captures are `overlay-compact.png` and `overlay-advanced.png`, with `-landscape` variants.

Review both portrait overlays before the device pass. Add live stream-menu captures for the same viewport/font matrix and check permission filtering, Quit app confirmation, mode persistence, Copy stats, the keyboard shortcut, German labels and PiP on a phone. Saved [settings](screenshots/04-settings.png), [bitrate](screenshots/06-bitrate.png), [PC profile](screenshots/09-host-profile.png), [pairing guide](screenshots/01-launch.png), [host details](screenshots/15-host-details.png) and [overlay](screenshots/07-latency-overlay.png) captures show UI fixtures, not measured hardware streaming performance.

## Flavors and outputs

| Flavor / task | Package / output |
| --- | --- |
| `nonRoot` | `com.butterpollo.client`; normal Android build, no root required. |
| `root` | `com.butterpollo.client.root`; older root mouse-capture path, with maximum SDK 25. |
| `:app:assembleNonRootDebug` | `app/build/outputs/apk/nonRoot/debug/app-nonRoot-debug.apk` |
| `:app:assembleNonRootRelease` | `app/build/outputs/apk/nonRoot/release/app-nonRoot-release.apk` |
| `:app:bundleNonRootRelease` | `app/build/outputs/bundle/nonRootRelease/app-nonRoot-release.aab` |
| Root equivalents | Replace `NonRoot` with `Root` in task names and `nonRoot` with `root` in output paths. |

Release builds enable R8 shrinking. The source namespace remains `com.limelight`; it is distinct from the Android package ID. English and German are the packaged locales.

## Release signing

The signing hook in [app/build.gradle](../app/build.gradle) reads these four values:

| Environment variable | Root `keystore.properties` entry |
| --- | --- |
| `BP_KEYSTORE` | `storeFile` |
| `BP_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | `storePassword` |
| `BP_KEY_ALIAS` | `keyAlias` |
| `BP_KEY_PASSWORD` | `keyPassword` |

Each nonempty environment variable overrides its matching property. Supply all four values using the existing release key. Relative keystore paths resolve from the repository root; use forward slashes in Windows property paths. The properties file and `*.jks`/`*.keystore` files are ignored by Git.

With no signing values, **release APKs and bundles use the debug key**, and Gradle prints a warning. Use these for local installation and R8 testing, and sign distributed builds with your release key. A partial signing configuration fails the build. Updates must use the installed app's signing identity.

Create a signing key once and retain it for future updates. JDK 17 supplies `keytool`; it prompts for the keystore password:

```sh
keytool -genkeypair -keystore rubylight.keystore -alias rubylight -keyalg RSA -keysize 3072 -validity 10000
```

An unsigned APK produced outside the normal Gradle signing path cannot be installed directly. With Android SDK Build Tools on your PATH, copy it to `rubylight-unsigned.apk`, align it, sign with the same key and verify:

```sh
zipalign -P 16 -f 4 rubylight-unsigned.apk rubylight-aligned.apk
apksigner sign --ks rubylight.keystore --ks-key-alias rubylight --out rubylight.apk rubylight-aligned.apk
apksigner verify --verbose rubylight.apk
adb install -r rubylight.apk
```

See Android's [APK signing instructions](https://developer.android.com/tools/apksigner).

Build the release APK and bundle directly:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat --no-daemon --max-workers=2 :app:assembleNonRootRelease :app:bundleNonRootRelease :app:lintNonRootRelease :app:testNonRootDebugUnitTest
```

Or use the existing artifact helper after the checks pass:

```powershell
.\scripts\build-release.ps1
```

The Linux helper is `bash scripts/build-release.sh`. Both helpers build an arm64 APK and a bundle with the default ABIs, then print SHA-256 hashes and byte sizes. They do not publish. Preserve `app/build/outputs/mapping/nonRootRelease/mapping.txt` and native debug symbols for the matching release.

Releases are built and published from a local machine with `gh release create`. Test prereleases carry a debug-signed arm64 APK; store uploads use the release key.

## Documentation checks

Use Python 3.10+ and Node.js 18+; these scripts use only standard libraries and do not install packages or contact the network.

```sh
python scripts/generate-settings.py
node --test scripts/check-doc-links.test.mjs
node scripts/check-doc-links.mjs
```

Use `python3` instead of `python` where that is your Python 3 command. The generator reads the real XML and Java presets; it fails if a preference lacks usage guidance or a preset expression needs review. The CI documentation job regenerates the page and uses `git diff --exit-code -- docs/settings.md` to reject stale committed output.

The link checker checks README and every Markdown page under `docs/`: relative file/image paths, filename case, Markdown heading fragments, explicit HTML anchors and reference links. External URLs are syntax-checked and counted, not fetched; an offline pass does not certify remote availability.
