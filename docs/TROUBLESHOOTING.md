# Troubleshooting

[Documentation](index.md)

Use the symptom below, then make one change and retry. For performance issues, open **stream menu → Overlay → Advanced** and **Copy stats** before changing settings.

## Add and pair a host

Follow the [PIN flow](pairing.md#pin-flow). Start on the same local network with the PC awake and the Rubylight host running.

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PC is not discovered | Discovery cannot cross the network boundary, the host is stopped, or a firewall blocks it. | Start the host; use **Add PC** with its local address. Check guest Wi-Fi isolation, VPN routes and the host firewall. |
| Manual address fails | Wrong address/port, no route, or service unavailable. | Enter the PC's address and streaming HTTP port, not the web console URL or Android's loopback address. For custom IPv6 ports use `[address]:port`. |
| PIN rejected or pairing stalls | Old PIN, expired one-time PIN, wrong passphrase or another pending request. | Cancel the attempt, clear the pending host request and use a fresh PIN. For a one-time PIN, enter both the host PIN and passphrase before expiry. |
| Pairing disappears after restore | Client identity is excluded from backup/device transfer. | Pair the restored installation again and revoke the obsolete device on the host. |
| Paired but no games appear | Application listing is denied, device disabled or host library empty. | Enable the device and List applications in host **Devices**; check the host library. |
| Video works but controls do not | Missing input permission or a view-only role. | Grant the required controller/mouse/keyboard/touch/pen permission. Open a normal game instead of Remote Monitor. |
| Clipboard or commands missing | Independent permissions or host capabilities are absent. | Grant Send clipboard, Read clipboard or Server commands as appropriate. Commands must be configured on the host. |

The client uses the host's advertised ports and custom-port offsets. Check the actual host configuration instead of opening a copied port list. A failed public Internet connectivity check does not prove that local streaming is blocked.

## Video, sound and latency

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Black/flickering image or misplaced video | Decoder or surface-path issue. | Try H.264 at 720p/60 with HDR/upscaling off. For conventional SDR, try **Advanced → Compatibility video view**. It is disabled for HDR/PyroWave. |
| Decoder crash | Codec, resolution or driver combination is unstable. | Try another codec and lower resolution/FPS. After repeated decoder crashes Rubylight may reset stream settings; check the PC override too. |
| Network loss or stutter | Bitrate exceeds a stable link budget, or traffic is bursty. | Lower bitrate; wire the PC; move closer to the access point. Try **Automatic bitrate** on a supporting host. |
| High Queue wait | Decoder input buffers or the submission thread are backed up. | Lower resolution/FPS and compare with Phone performance hints off. |
| High Decode time | Decoder/driver scheduling or decoding is slow. | Compare H.264, HEVC and AV1, then reduce resolution/FPS or disable HDR/4:4:4. |
| Healthy decode but low shown FPS | Presentation, pacing, callback availability or display policy. | Compare Lowest latency/VRR and a rate the screen supports. Check power-saving modes. Shown FPS may be unavailable on some output paths. |
| High Host processing | PC capture/encoder/game workload. | Reduce the host workload and compare host logs; Android decoder settings cannot remove host processing time. |
| HDR is washed out or absent | HDR capability, metadata or range mismatch. | Verify HDR on the host display and Android screen; return full-range override to Off and inspect the negotiated codec/HDR mode. |
| Upscaler reports direct output | HDR/10-bit/PyroWave, no size increase, unsupported GPU path or a runtime fallback. | Read the fallback reason. Compare a lower-resolution SDR stream; reconnect after an overload fallback. |
| PyroWave unavailable | Unsupported Android ABI/Vulkan features, host codec version or surface format. | Read the codec readiness message; use Automatic/HEVC/AV1 on unsupported devices. Test link throughput before raising PyroWave bitrate. |
| Heat, battery drain or degraded performance over time | Sustained high decode/GPU/display workload. | Try Battery saver, lower FPS/resolution or turn upscaling off. Compare a sustained run, not only the first minute. |
| No sound or wrong channels | Output routing, surround mismatch or host audio configuration. | Try Stereo, confirm Android volume/output and the host audio device, then reconnect. |
| Audio delay or glitches | Effects, output route or buffer recovery. | Disable Allow system audio effects, compare another output route and Stereo, and record whether glitches follow a route change. |

See [video and latency](video-and-latency.md#performance-overlay) for metric definitions. Network RTT plus decode time is not an end-to-end latency measurement.

## Controls, profiles and installation

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| USB DualSense has no adaptive triggers | Direct USB driver is off, access denied, or host feedback unavailable. | Enable **Advanced → USB DualSense driver**, reconnect the cable and allow USB access during a stream. Check host support. Bluetooth uses Android's input path. |
| Mouse look behaves like a desktop cursor | Desktop mouse mode or capture state. | Turn Desktop mouse mode off and use Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Z to recapture input. |
| Controller stick drifts | Deadzone too small for that pad/game. | Increase Analog stick deadzone slightly and compare. |
| Touch behaves like a mouse | Trackpad/Direct mouse selected, or native touch unavailable. | Select Multi-touch and grant Touch input on the host. A host without native touch falls back to Direct mouse. |
| Preset or global change seems ignored | A saved PC profile overrides global stream settings. | Long-press the PC, open **This PC → Stream settings**, enable **Use global settings**, and save. |
| Reset did not remove a controller mapping or layout | Global reset intentionally preserves them. | Reset the controller in Controller buttons or use Reset controls layout. |
| APK update is rejected | Different signing key or incompatible build. | Use an update signed by the installed app's key. Uninstalling permits a different key but removes local app data and pairing identity. |
| PC will not wake | Missing MAC, NIC/firmware policy, Wi-Fi or routing limitation. | Pair once while awake; enable Wake-on-LAN; test Ethernet and sleep on the same subnet. |
| Frontend cannot open a game file | Missing URI permission, invalid entry or unpaired PC. | Re-export after opening the paired PC's library; follow [frontend setup](FRONTENDS.md). |

## Connection test

Long-press a PC and choose **This PC → Test your connection**. The test makes ten timed server-info requests. Ping is their average round trip; jitter is the average change between consecutive successful requests. Failed probes are HTTP failures, not video packet loss.

On a paired supporting host, the optional 32 MiB HTTPS download reports throughput and the host adapter's reported link speed. It uses network data and may temporarily compete with other traffic. Cancel or leave the test to stop it. None of these measurements changes stream settings.

## Export a problem report

1. Reproduce the problem and note the app version, device/Android version, host version and time.
2. Open **Settings → App → Report a problem**, select **Share** and choose a receiving app in Android's share sheet.
3. Attach Advanced **Copy stats** and **Settings → Advanced → Export latency CSV** when relevant.
4. For pairing/host issues, long-press the PC, use **This PC → View details → Copy debug info**, and add the relevant host log.
5. Describe what you did, what you expected and what occurred in a [Rubylight Android issue](https://github.com/RamazanKara/rubylight-android/issues).

The report is a text file named `butterpollo-problem.txt`. It contains up to 200 redacted events from the current app process, the last decoder configuration and the last saved crash record. Addresses, user-assigned host/device names, PINs, credentials and free-text diagnostic details are omitted. Nothing is uploaded automatically; sharing begins only when you choose a receiving app. Review separately copied host details/logs before sharing them.
