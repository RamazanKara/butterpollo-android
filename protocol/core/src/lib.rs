//! Rubylight wire formats, written once for the host and its clients.
//!
//! Both sides used to carry their own copy of each format: the host in `butterpollo-core`
//! (Rust), the Android client in C and C++. This crate is the single definition. It is
//! `no_std` with `alloc` and has no dependencies, so it builds into the Windows host as an
//! ordinary dependency and into the Android client as a static library through
//! `rubylight-protocol-ffi`.
